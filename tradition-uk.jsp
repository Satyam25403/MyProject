        <h3>1.FARMING PRACTICES AND CROPS:</h3>
        <h4>TERRACE FARMING</h4>
        <p>
            Terrace farming is a traditional practice in the hilly regions of Uttarakhand, where farmers create step-like fields to reduce soil erosion and enhance water retention. This method is ideal for cultivating crops like rice, wheat, and millets on steep slopes. It allows efficient use of land while conserving the environment and water resources.
        </p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <h4>ORGANIC FARMING</h4>
        <p>
            Organic farming in Uttarakhand focuses on using natural fertilizers like compost, cow dung, and green manure, avoiding chemical pesticides and fertilizers. This eco-friendly approach is especially suited for the state's fertile soils and clean environment. Farmers in the region often seek organic certification for premium prices in domestic and international markets.
        </p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <h4>MIXED CROPPING</h4>
        <p>Mixed cropping is the practice of growing multiple crops together on the same plot to optimize land use, improve soil fertility, and reduce pest risks. Common combinations in Uttarakhand include growing millets with pulses or wheat with mustard. This approach ensures food security and reduces the financial risks of crop failure due to weather or pests.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <h4>HORTICULTURE</h4>
        <p>Horticulture in Uttarakhand is primarily focused on temperate fruits such as apples, pears, peaches, and apricots, which thrive in the state's cooler climate. The fertile valleys and cool temperatures make it an ideal region for fruit orchards. Additionally, the state is also known for cultivating medicinal plants and aromatic herbs like lavender and rosemary.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <h4>MEDICINAL AND AROMATIC PLANT FARMING</h4>

        <h4>TRADITIONAL IRRIGATIONAL SYSTEMS</h4>
        <p>Traditional irrigation systems in Uttarakhand, like guls (water channels) and kuls (gravity-fed irrigation systems), are essential for directing mountain streams to irrigate terraced fields. These systems utilize gravity to conserve water and minimize the need for external infrastructure. They reflect the community's deep understanding of water conservation in hilly areas.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <h4>ORGANIC FERTILIZERS</h4>
        <p>Farmers in Uttarakhand use organic fertilizers such as cow dung, compost, and manure to enrich the soil and enhance crop yield. This practice is rooted in sustainable farming techniques that avoid chemical fertilizers and maintain soil health. Organic fertilizers help preserve the environment while promoting the production of healthy, chemical-free crops.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <h4>INDIGENOUS SEED STORAGE TECHNIQUES</h4>
